# ## Controllable cognitive architecture for any task

# LangGraph's flexible framework supports diverse control flows ‚Äì single agent,
# multi-agent, hierarchical, sequential ‚Äì and robustly handles realistic,
# complex scenarios.  
  
# Ensure reliability with easy-to-add moderation and quality loops that prevent
# agents from veering off course.  
  
# Use LangGraph Platform to templatize your cognitive architecture so that
# tools, prompts, and models are easily configurable with LangGraph Platform
# Assistants.

# [See the docs ](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)

# ## Designed for human-agent collaboration

# With built-in statefulness, LangGraph agents seamlessly collaborate with
# humans by writing drafts for review and awaiting approval before acting.
# Easily inspect the agent‚Äôs actions and "time-travel" to roll back and take a
# different action to correct course.

# ## LangGraph FAQs

# Do I need to use LangChain to use LangGraph? What‚Äôs the difference?

# No. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is
# more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. LangChain provides a
# standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for
# straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.

# How is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?

# Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for
# complex tasks bespoke to a company‚Äôs needs. LangGraph provides a more
# expressive framework to handle companies‚Äô unique tasks without restricting
# users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.

# Does LangGraph impact the performance of my app?

# LangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed
# with streaming workflows in mind.

# Is LangGraph open source? Is it free?

# Yes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.

# How are LangGraph and LangGraph Platform different?

# LangGraph is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to
# agent workflows. LangGraph Platform is a service for deploying and scaling
# LangGraph applications, with an opinionated API for building agent UXs, plus
# an integrated developer studio.

# What are my deployment options for LangGraph Platform?

# We currently have the following deployment options for LangGraph applications:  
  
# ‚Äç**Self-Hosted Lite** : A free (up to 1M nodes executed), limited version of
# LangGraph Platform that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner. This
# version requires a LangSmith API key and logs all usage to LangSmith. Fewer
# features are available than in paid plans.  
# ‚Äç**Cloud SaaS:** Fully managed and hosted as part of LangSmith, with automatic
# updates and zero maintenance.  
# ‚Äç**Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC):** Deploy LangGraph Platform within your VPC,
# provisioned and run as a service. Keep data in your environment while
# outsourcing the management of the service.  
# **Self-Hosted Enterprise:** Deploy LangGraph entirely on your own
# infrastructure.

# Is LangGraph Platform open source?

# No. LangGraph Platform is proprietary software.  
  
# There is a free, self-hosted version of LangGraph Platform with access to
# basic features. The Cloud SaaS deployment option is free while in beta, but
# will eventually be a paid service. We will always give ample notice before
# charging for a service and reward our early adopters with preferential
# pricing. The Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) and Self-Hosted Enterprise options
# are also paid services. [Contact our sales team](/contact-sales) to learn
# more.
